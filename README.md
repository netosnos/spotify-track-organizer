This project helps you organize your Spotify liked songs into mood-based playlists using audio features and genre analysis. It automatically creates and populates playlists like "Chill Vibes", "Feel-Good", "Sad & Moody", "Party Mode", "Training & High Energy", and "Driving Mix".

## Features

- Automatically fetches your liked songs from Spotify
- Analyzes audio features (tempo, energy, danceability, etc.) to classify songs
- Uses genre information for songs without audio features
- Creates mood-based playlists and organizes your music
- Handles both English and Spanish songs
- Supports a large number of tracks

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- A Spotify account
- Spotify Developer account and API credentials

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/netosnos/spotify-track-organizer.git
   cd spotify-track-organizer
   ```

2. **Create a Spotify Developer Account:**
   - Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
   - Log in with your Spotify account
   - Click "Create App"
   - Fill in the app details (name, description, etc.)
   - Add `http://localhost:8888/callback` as a Redirect URI in your app settings

3. **Get Your API Credentials:**
   - In your app's dashboard, you'll find:
     - Client ID
     - Client Secret
   - Keep these credentials secure and never share them

4. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root
   - Add your credentials:
     ```
     SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
     SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
     SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8888/callback
     ```

5. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

6. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

7. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

The project processes your Spotify liked songs through several steps. Run the scripts in this order:

1. **Fetch Liked Songs:**
   ```bash
   python3 src/scripts/get_liked_songs.py
   ```
   - This will fetch all your liked songs and save them to `data/raw/liked_songs.json`
   - You'll need to authenticate with Spotify when prompted

2. **Get Audio Features:**
   ```bash
   python3 src/scripts/get_audio_features.py
   ```
   - Fetches audio features for your tracks
   - Saves them to `data/processed/tracks_with_audio_features.json`

3. **Get RaccoonBeats IDs:**
   ```bash
   python3 src/scripts/get_reccobeats_ids.py
   ```
   - Processes your liked songs and splits them into two files:
     - `data/processed/tracks_with_raccobeats_ids.json`
     - `data/processed/tracks_without_raccobeats_ids.json`

4. **Create Playlists:**
   ```bash
   python3 src/scripts/create_playlists.py
   ```
   - Creates and populates your playlists based on the analysis
   - By default, runs in dry-run mode (doesn't create playlists)
   - To create real playlists, set `dry_run = False` in the script

## Playlist Categories

The script creates the following playlists:

- **Chill Vibes**: Soft, mellow, and relaxing tracks
- **Feel-Good**: Happy, upbeat, and energizing songs
- **Sad & Moody**: Emotional, introspective, or melancholic songs
- **Party Mode**: High-energy, danceable tracks
- **Training & High Energy**: Fast-paced, energetic tracks
- **Driving Mix**: Balanced, rhythmic songs for road trips
- **Other**: Songs that don't fit the above categories

## Notes

- All JSON files are automatically generated by the scripts
- The first run might take some time depending on the number of liked songs
- You can modify the playlist categories and their genre lists in the scripts
- The script handles both English and Spanish songs
